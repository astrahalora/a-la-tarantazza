        review: "Most delicious pies I've ever had! My first time, I tried having only one slice and ended up cleaning the box and ordering another one by sundown. 10/10 I'll keep doing it."

        review: "As a foodie, I try to recreate most recipes I like, but after five tries, it's important to admit that A La Tarantazza has achieved something truly irreplicable. I've considered getting a job there to find out their secret ingredients."

        review: "I'm not a picky eater but A La Tarantazza has spoiled me. Now I can't eat cake unless we get one from them and I don't think there's any better pizza place in this city. Do I regret it? Not a chance! Everyone has their own comfort food."
